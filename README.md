# IO-AlteredOrbits
A set of configs that alter the orbits and properties of celestial bodies, for stock and some other planet packs.

Some of these configs change the orbits and/or properties of bodies to: more closely resemble their real-life analogues; increase interest and difficulty; alignment with axial tilts supplied by ***IO-PrincipiaGravityModels***, or general enhancements.

Supports ***stock***, ***OPM***, ***MPE***, ***Extrasolar***, & ***GEP***. I felt no need to provide edits for ***NeidonPlus***, ***JanetsPlanets***, and ***Kcalbeloh***.

NOTE: The *NEEDS[Principia]* in these configs refers to the inclusion of ***IO-PrincipiaGravityModels***. If you are not using ***Principia***, these configs will still work; and if you *are* using ***Principia***, then there should be no reason not to use the ***IO-PrincipiaGravityModels***.
